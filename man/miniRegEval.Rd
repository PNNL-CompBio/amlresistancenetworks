Runs lasso regression on a single feature from tabular data and evaluates on a second set of data.
This is a little more complicated than LOO

\usage{
miniRegEval(
  trainTab,
  testTab,
  mol.feature = "Gene",
  feature.val = "mRNALevels",
  enet.alpha = c(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainTab}{with column names `AML sample`,meanVal,Gene, and whatever the value of `mol.feature` is.}

\item{testTab}{with column names `Sample`, meanVal, Gene, and whatever the value of `mol.feature` is}

\item{mol.feature}{list of molecular features to be evaluated}
}
\value{
a data.frame with three values/columns: MSE, numFeatures, and Genes
}
